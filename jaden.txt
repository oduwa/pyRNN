Man, I'm PCH cruising
My girl she snoozing
She was all night boozing
No love, here to be losing
I don't care who's in
The car cause really
Really we just PCH cruising
My girl snoozing
She was all night boozing
No love, here to be losing
I don't care who's in
The car cause really
Really we just PCH cruising

We just PCH, PCH, PCH, PCH driving
We're the crazy kids, rebel kids, saddened kids, wild kids, lonely kids

Gimmie all your kisses baby
Cause this is bliss
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Cause this is bliss
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Cause this is bliss
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Gimmie all your kisses baby
Cause this is bliss
Gimmie all your kisses baby

You can come and cry if you come through
You can hug the sky if you want to
You can come and cry if you come through
You can hug the sky if you want to
Cause you're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
And the moon is full, moon is full, moon is full, moon is full

We just PCH, PCH, PCH, PCH driving
We're the crazy kids, rebel kids, saddened kids, wild kids, lonely kids

Gimmie all your kisses baby
Cause this is bliss
Gimmie all your kisses baby

Baby you can be my catfish
I never see you I just text you on the phone
And you look just like that actress
What's the name?
I'm afraid that if I see I'm freakin' suffocate
Or do a backflip
Yeah, I'm knocking at your door
But I died so they put me in a casket
People say Jay your just over-reacting
But your like the girl that I never had
You're my catfish

Doin' what we ain't 'posed to, girl, that's why I chose you
I don't want to impose, just listen close to my poems
Girl don't worry, ain't nobody know
This the type of stuff a joker keepin' on the low
Cause girl you know you're beautiful, a space kitten
Relationships are messed up but your face isn't
Used to taste like Jolly Ranchers
Kisses, now they taste different
Michael Jordan say "Hey Pippen"
Weightliftin', I hate sippin'
Ain't listen, paint glistenin' from the renaissance
Got a problem with the weather, fix it in the tennis box
Black helicopters, even let my menace watch
Keep it clean as Mr. Clean so jokers wear my Dennis socks
Look what I invented, y'all
Hit it with a tennis ball, no consent, I rented y'all
Land in the center, y'all, 3 dimes and a nickel
3 dimes and I write the reciprocal with a pencil
Luckily I'm your principal, luckily there's no principles
Except that you're invincible, only weakened the intervals
So listen close

You might not like me, but I like you
You might not like me, but I like you
We should just let it breathe
Let it breathe, let itâ€”

I love you, without a reason
Like a baby was teethin', knew you 'fore I was breathin'
People say I'm a heathen, a Hollywood fugitive
Trippin' on some stupid ish, it's really just some ludicrous
Like "Who is this?" Oh he talk a lot of mess and bro
I'm too legit, you see that symbol on my chest
So you should move and sit, because you'll leak it to the press
If I sneeze in front of you, put my steez in front of you
Me and Moises whippin' the Porsche
And we ease in front of you
What you wanna do?
As long as there ain't helicopters I'm down to chill
I don't wanna call my father but swear that I will
Just to conversate and then I'll take care of the bill
Man I never thought I'd fly off to Paris for real
And all of my parents for real
Man I start to see how fictional characters feel
And that issue embarrass me still
Oh don't worry lil' homie, take care of the will
Polly's gone, but he left me his parrot, it's trill
He says, "Redrum, redrum"
He says, "Redrum, redrum"
He says, "Redrum, redrum"
And they run, they run
And they come, they come
And they run, they run


Sidelines in pride times, no lions
I'm so lyin' if I say I wasn't tryin' to buy into these games
Cupid ain't do no flyin', angels ain't do no cryin', just sighin'
I am 14, I got knots, there will be no tyin'
No Mayan can tell me what time I'ma find my mind
So when I'm in my deathbed dyin'
Imma be in some high end clothes with a MSFTS
Tie in my hand
With that red loud siren
I won't be denyin' my evil deeds
I'll be at Heaven's gate with a crowbar pryin'
While they're screamin, "Don't let this guy in"
Feelin' sorry for myself, Catcher in the Rye-in'
Then I woke up lyin' on the beach
One more for the kids before they go to sleep
Love is just so nonexistent in my existence
So that's why I was so persistent in that first quick instant
That we laid eyes
If young love for them is 16 then we must be infants
Cause this is intense, but I'm an eyewitness at love at first sight
But this is just different than anything I've been in
Cause it feels infinite
Most things that you think will last will pass in the blink of a lash
So I think I will submerge my feelings to complete this task
And best believe I'll drown before I let us crash
And seal it from the past
Jeez

The girl I could never have is elegant and intelligent
And I just kind of fell, but I'm irrelevant in her eyes
And this is somethin' I can settle with
I'm pourin' out my heart, and girl it's kind of for the hell of it
Girl you know that I ain't celibate
I know who your fellow is but we can walk the park
We can talk and we embellish in the creatures after dark
Cause I know that I'm a rebel kid
We come from different elements
But baby girl I can tell I get
On your nerves, I'm watchin' you observe
It's like the world's an ocean and I watch while you emerge
You the center of attention, girl, no matter what occurs
Cause this youth is like a curse, but it's also like a blessing
Cause I keep these jokers guessing, MSFTS rep is what I'm dressed in
'Til these jokers learn a lesson
If you messin' with my clique, I suggest you get to steppin'
Girl, you're like Juliet with your nurse
And you're lookin' so pretty and I've just been on a search
You're the type of girl that I couldn't just write a verse
So I hit it with the poetry, hopin' that it'll work
If it doesn't then it's fine cause I'll just handle the jerks
Girl I'm playin', no I'm serious, that's just one of my perks
If we're friends then it's cool, just know that we were here first
Through the thick and the thin and now we're here 'til it hurts

Babygirl you got me floatin' down
Anywhere you wanna go
Babygirl you got me floatin' down
We can take it really slow
Babygirl you got me floatin' down
We can keep it on the low
Babygirl you got me floatin' down
And I didn't even know


I can feel your body tryna come alive, come alive
I feel you tryna pull me deep inside, deep inside
No I don't wanna lie
Ain't nobody gotta hide, no
I can feel you touchin' me when we're home, we're old
Now I like to look at you, you're like my clone
So don't stare in the mirror
Cause I'll poop all on your party
I don't drive no white Ferrari
No things aren't clearer
I just want to say I'm sorry
But girl you should know yourself
These things ain't gettin' better
No they ain't lookin' up for us
Kissin' you, I'm up to dusk
So paparazzi hush and shush
She was in her 20's, just a crush
But you know I like it when you tell 'em
Bring the whole damn menu
And we eatin' in the venue
Girl you know you like to ball
Chillin' with your friends, nah, ain't see that at all
Man we like the Anunnaki, God ain't them jokers tall
You can't buy that at the mall
True love, you can't try that at the mall

No yeah, um we were really good in Paris, but you know
Every relationship has ups and downs and the downhills are what makes the uphills
So when I'm feeling all this pain and feel like she doesn't love me or whatever
It's just that contrast, but when I feel like she's the only person in the world I want to be with
Just contrast with those times, you know what I'm saying?

Man I got some more to say
Have you ever had a crush?
Have you ever felt a rush?
Make your heart stop, she don't even like to blush
Cause she's in her 20's
And I got a crush
Oh man I got a crush
Got a psychedelic dagger in my heart
Lil' homie, tell them paramedics rush cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's
Man I'm 15 on the scene, lookin' clean
But what does that mean? Cause she's in her 20's
I got somethin' to say
Have you ever had a crush?
Have you ever had a rush?
Make my heart stop, but she didn't even blush
Cause she's in her 20's
Have you ever felt lust? Cause she's in her 20's
Have you ever felt lust? Cause she's in her 20's
Have you ever felt lust? Cause she's in her 20's
She's somebody you can trust cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's
Cause she's in her 20's

I hate crushes, I cover bruises with paintbrushes
Pour it all in the music now that my bank's ruptured
So pretty, she's so perfect, she's so worth it
So bossy, she's so assertive, it's super sexy
She never texts me, she never texts me, she never texts me
Never texts me, she never texts me, forgot to text me
Well I guess we accept the ones that neglect us
And my moms say that we disrespect the ones that perfect us
And try to protect us
But girl I hope that you get this
My thoughts are weighin' me down
My neck can't handle the necklace
Stare at you while you sleep, you had to call a detective
Your father says that I'm reckless, I didn't cause all that wreckage
Your fence was broken, I left it, had to give you this message
I wrote it straight from the soul and it didn't make sense to text it
So I snuck up in your room, put it on your shoulder and in return
You sent me back a restraining order

Welcome to my paradise
You can have a pair of dice
You gettin' hungry, we can share a slice
You gettin' uncomfortable like my parents' fights
I'd rather brush it off so I can take you to them Paris lights
I'm the type of kid to cherish nights
'Less I'm trapped in a love that's poisoned with parasites
Now you're gon' tell me you're embarrassed, right?
And now my ego's 'bout as tall as some ferris heights
But now our love's getting scarce
I tried to pray to the love but I seen no doves in the air
Girl I'll go get your mascara
And your Alexander McQueen
So bright, take my hand, we've entered a dream
Can't you tell by the change in the theme?
I'm wearin' ripped up Vans and a hood by Supreme
Guess my subconscious wants me to be a regular teen
Now listen

I get pretty lost in my head
Rather than a dead seed
I try to blossom instead, take notes

I swear I'm out of my mind
I swear I'm all out of time
It's only been 5 minutes
I swear I'm out of my mind
Can't get Paris out of my mind
Can't get my parents out of my mind
Man, I swear everybody's like parrots all of the time
They don't listen, infatuated with kissin'
They don't see the 144 dimensions they're missin' but it's fine
She can't put in her weave, I'm really hatin' her attitude
My friends want me to leave, well I'ma do what I have to do
Cause life has really been scarin' me
And nobody's strong enough to come carry me
I'm dealin' with my parents and apparently
They say I qualify for some psychiatrical therapy
I'm outâ€”

I get pretty lost in my head
Rather than a dead seed
I try to blossom instead, take notes

I'm zoned, I'm zoned, I'm zoned
I'm zoned, I'm zoned, I'm zoned
You should probably take me home
I'm zoned, I'm zoned, I'm zoned

You're makin' me crazy
Let's talk about where you're takin' me
Wanna live in your heart but baby is there a vacancy?
We can just make the drive whenever I'm feelin' Vegasy
What's up with the bandanas? Yeah it goes with my legacy
Get it? You probably bold as my agency
Like every night you stay with me I feel like a Navy Seal
Flyin' on a blaine, Mr. David is real
Don't talk about this like it's fun, homie this famous ish kills
Flyin' on a train with no wheels, I made it myself
Magnetize it with a ratchet, cut the chains in a cell
Your brain is a cell, unleash it like the roof of an eagle
Fly in the sky and then go land in Ibiza
And while I'm walkin' to Egypt

You're makin' me crazy
You're makin' me crazy, you're makin' me
You're makin' me crazy
You're makin' me crazy, you're makin' me

I'm so vibey, man I dare all you jokers to try me
Treat me highly, bout as high as them secret societies
Secret societies, secretly they've all been eyein' me
Christopher Syre, they said that they ready to sire me
Said that they ready to hire me
Well I don't know where all of them flyers be
You not gon' find a mason fly as me
You not gon' find a mason fly as me
I hate you jokers entirely
Sorry but you tire me, you be like "where your tires be?"
But that no gravity Tesla's what I got
And I'm respectful so I'm not gon' tell you what I dropped
But it's hot, it's next on as a text, go get my flex on
Killin' people for oil, it's kinda like you're Exxon
But war's what a joker tryna put an X on
I'ma do it until all my freakin' checks gone
Until my next's gone, and put my decks on eBay and sell 'em
Any MSFTS in the world don't know, go run and tell 'em
Bout to be a rebellion, it's the indigos
It's the indigos, go grab every friend you know
And hold hands 'til you are invincible
Put a forcefield around you, feel it head to toe
And don't stop 'til you jokers think you're cool as eskimos
We are inside you and we're calm and yet connected
And anything offends, at second guess we will deflect it
And anything that's truthful and genuine, we'll accept it
We're the collective and we'll show you to the exit
We're the collectiveâ€”we'll show you to the exit

If the party on fire then I prolly lit the match
MSFTS my burr and you jokers ain't a match
Scratch, scratch, shkrrrr, man I call that Jazzy Jeff
'Less you with Republic, then I play you to the left

You need a disclaimer, just because these jokers famous
Doesn't mean when they get reckless
That they don't be actin' brainless
You forgettin' I don't even have my license
Cops still pull a joker over cause he light skinned
I ain't really with the wifin'
I just chill with TÃ©o, baby don't forget the hyphen
All nightin', sight seein' errday
I buy a pair of Js just so I can scare the day away
I could care less what the sheriff say
I got a pair of shades and now I'm duckin' from the Paris maid
Probably catch me in a taxi, with some khakis and a cap
I'm tryna run so they don't catch me
Yeah, I'm tryna run so they don't catch me
And you think I got the cash on me, I'm never lookin' flashy
Dang he never lookin' flashy, rappin' circles 'round these jokers
Man you way too freakin' corny, tag a Urkel on these jokers

Man I'm trappin' like a hot boy
All my failures crush your successes
Got me flippin' like a skateboard
Get off me, I'm on that next ish

If the party on fire then I prolly lit the match
MSFTS my burr and you jokers ain't a match
Scratch, scratch, shkrrrr, man I call that Jazzy Jeff
'Less you with Republic, then I play you to the left
If the party on fire then I prolly lit the match
MSFTS my burr and you jokers ain't a match
Scratch, scratch, shkrrrr, man I call that Jazzy Jeff
'Less you with Republic, then I play you to the left

Man I'm trappin' like a hot boy
All my failures crush your successes
Got me flippin' like a skateboard
Get off me, I'm on that next ish

Young, young - fresh, fresh
Reckless, reckless - reckless, reckless

Young, reckless, hit you, put some ice on it
Got a bet, homie, roll some dice on it
Yeah, I'mma ball, mamacita you look nice on it
O, and Chaos made the beat, but Teo put some spice on it
Yeah, yeah, my vocal sound nice on it
Yeah, gets really cold her at night, don't it?
Yeah, because you chilling with the coldest
Man, I spit you knowledge cause you need to know this
Man, you listen to these lyrics, you say kill the kid that wrote this
Man, I write my opus, man, my book is open
All you jokes lokers, hokus pokus, sexy models poke us
You disloyal punks, you laughing, I don't understand your jokes
But I'mma keep it moving
How you gon' tell us that we not the dopest?
Jab you in the face just to show you where the rope is
Man, you talking future, homie, we probably the closest
But why this girl texting me asking where all her clothes is?
I'm losing my focus, these rhymes are provoking
My arms are convulsing, how many times have I wrote this?
Wait, I think I'm straight losing my memory
But that'll be the thing that make sure you remember me
You jokers stupid like drinking Hennessy, go to Tennesse
Think you better than me? Well, homie, let's just wait and see

Cause I'm young, young - fresh, fresh
Then we reckless, reckless - reckless, reckless
Young, young - fresh, fresh
Then we reckless, reckless - reckless, reckless

I flip words like light flips of a disco
Got a problem then let's go, shooting of like a pistol
You gon' make it rain, well, I ain't afraid of no drizzle
You keep rizzle, I keep you checked with the shizzle
Drop it all just to go pre-order the trizzle
Cause you don't know jack about that Tesla
Cause I just came back with my fresh cut
So guess what, man, I'm walking with my chest up
The butterfly doors make a joker look fresh, huh
Johnny Depp steez, get off of the steps please
We get all the fish in the sea cause we on jetskis
Smith cool as the Gretsky's, we back back in the West Indie's
Making some fresh tee's where the pigs can't arrest me
Your mic dusty, you sure rusty, you jokers must be
On vacation cause you can't touch me, it's ugly
I flip words like kickflips in the 'burbs
Like nothing you've never heard, a Jazzy Jeff when he turns
Man, this kid is absurd, where'd he get all these words?
Probably from them stupid books he's reading
And imprints on his shirts
Like you don't know jack about that new school
Jokers from way back complaining we too cool
We reckless
